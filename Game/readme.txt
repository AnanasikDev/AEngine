Controls:

WASD / arrows to accelerate
Space to attach to the nearest hook

About the game:

You are controlling a sphere in the center which you can accelerate in any of 8 directions using WASD/arrows (directions are absolute, meaning they are independent of the current state of the sphere). When colliding you do not lose speed. Colliding with so-called "blobs" (large blue spheres) increases your time left; the greater the speed at which you collide with them is, the more time is granted. Later, walls will start appearing, which you should avoid as they decrease your time left. Then, hooks (little blue dots) will spawn and you can attach to the nearest one by pressing Space. They accelerate you towards them simulating the centripetal force, which can be used to change direction or increase speed. Hooks should be used carefully to avoid losing speed or control.
