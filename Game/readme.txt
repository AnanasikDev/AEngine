About the game:

You are controlling a sphere in the center which you can accelerate in any of 8 directions. When colliding you do not lose speed. Colliding with so-called "blobs" (large blue spheres) increases your time left; the greater the speed at which you collide with them, the more time is granted. Later, walls will start appearing, which you should avoid as they decrease your time left. Then, hooks (little blue dots) will start appearing, which you can attach to by pressing Space. It connects to the nearest hook. They can accelerate you further and change movement direction.
